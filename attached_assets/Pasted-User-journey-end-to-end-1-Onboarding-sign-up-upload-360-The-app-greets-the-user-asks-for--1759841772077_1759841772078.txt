User journey (end to end)
1) Onboarding: sign up → upload 360
● The app greets the user, asks for a basic account, then immediately asks for their 360 report. No detours, no treasure hunt.
● They drag in a PDF/CSV. A progress bar shows “Uploading → Reading → Summarising.”
● When it’s done, the app confirms what it learned in plain English and lets the user tweak anything obvious (name, role, values).
● Gatekeeping that actually helps: the rest of the app stays locked until the report is uploaded or they choose a sample report.
Outcome: user lands with a seeded profile instead of a blank slate.
2) Home: Profile Overview
● A tidy dashboard says “Here’s you”
● Cards show:
○ Growth profile and personal values
○ A short summary of the 360
○ Red Zones (watch-outs) and Green Zones (strengths to lean on)
○ A few practical recommendations
● Two planning areas live here:
○ OBP: objectives and simple checklists
○ Immunity to Change: commitments, competing commitments, and small experiments
● Everything is editable. Changes are reflected everywhere else, because consistency is not optional.
Outcome: the user knows what the app thinks about them and what to do next.
3) Hero area: Chat (freeform, like ChatGPT)
● Big chat window. Type normal questions: “What should I focus on before my mid-year review?” or “Rewrite this feedback so it lands.”
● The chat quietly uses their 360 summary, values, and plans as context. Visible chips show what context is in play. Nothing creepy, just honest.
● One-tap shortcuts jump to the structured tools: Prepare, Role Play, Pulse.
Outcome: fast help for whatever’s front-of-mind, without digging through menus.
4) Structured Conversations
This is where the user does more deliberate work. Three tools, one shelf.
A) Prepare for a conversation
● A short wizard asks: goal, stakeholders, key points, likely blockers, actions.
● At the end, the user gets a one-page brief and a small checklist they can actually use.
● Saved to history; shows up in chat context when relevant.
Outcome: they walk in prepared, not just inspired.
B) Role Play
● The user picks a scenario and a persona. They practise the conversation with an AI actor.
● Instant feedback panel: what they did well, what fell flat, suggested lines to try.
● Transcript and feedback are saved, so improvement is visible over time.
Outcome: safer practice, better reps, fewer “wish I’d said” moments.
C) Pulse Survey (from their organisation or manual)
● If their org is connected, the latest pulse appears. If not, they can enter quick answers themselves.
● The app shows simple trends over time and nudges relevant recommendations.
Outcome: a lightweight way to keep a finger on the vibe without drowning in charts.
Navigation that doesn’t fight the user
● Three tabs: Profile, Chat, Conversations.
● Conversations opens to a page with three clear tiles: Prepare, Role Play, Pulse. No nesting doll menus.
Guardrails that feel like help
● If the 360 isn’t uploaded, the app invites the user to do that first or use a sample.
● If a profile field looks empty, a gentle nudge appears where it’s needed, not as a lecture.
● Privacy is explicit: your report and chats are private to you. Full stop.
Moments that matter (success checkpoints)
● Report uploaded and parsed
● First useful recommendation saved
● First chat that references their profile
● First prepared brief exported or checked off
● First role play completed with feedback
● First pulse update and a trend line shown
Tone and micro-copy (because words do heavy lifting)
● “Upload your 360. I’ll read it and pull out the good stuff.”
● “These are your Red Zones. We’ll work around them, not through denial.”
● “Ready to practise? I’ll be the difficult stakeholder. You’re welcome.”
Mobile reality check
● Upload supports files from email or cloud storage.
● Chat and Prepare are single-column and thumb-friendly.
● Role Play runs fine on the train; transcripts save automatically when the user bails at their stop.
